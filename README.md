## Since the whole app is more than 100 files im not able to upload everything, therefore I uploaded the main components which are in the lib folder.

- I opened the code in my Visual Studio Code
- Run the phone emulator in Android Studio
- Open terminal in Visual Studio Code
- flutter clean
- flutter pub get
- flutter run
